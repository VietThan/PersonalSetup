# Mac Setup

1. [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is terminal of choice (over the Mac default).
    1. Change key mappings to [Natural Text Editing](https://superuser.com/a/1157575)
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is almost always the first install.

## History

1. I joined AppCard in 2021 and they gave me a 2019 8GB RAM M1 Pro. I have to begrudgingly admit that a Macbook is pretty great. 
2. In 2023, for my birthday I gifted myself a 18GB M3 Pro.
3. In early 2024, AppCard upgraded me to a 24GB M2 Air.
